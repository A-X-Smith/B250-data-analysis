# Demultiplexing
Let's take a dataset 20910 as an example. This is a mouse dataset.

## Download the data
1. When dataset is ready -> receive an email
2. Download the data: `/icgc/dkfzlsdf/analysis/OE0532/software/diricore/utils/get_data.sh 20910`
3. After that the dataset has been downloaded to: `/icgc/dkfzlsdf/analysis/OE0532/20910`
4. If the data needs to be downloaded to another location (or under another username) then open the script and modify it:  `/icgc/dkfzlsdf/analysis/OE0532/software/diricore/utils/get_data.sh`

## Demultiplexing
Now let's see what kind of dataset we received.
1. Open ILSE: `https://ilseform.dkfz.de/ilse-wui/secure/mySubmissions.jsf` and click on the dataset
We get a table which looks more or less like that:
